This project incorporats data from the [SpaceNet 3 Challenge](https://spacenet.ai/spacenet-roads-dataset/). Although the original dataset is too large to be uploaded to this GitHub Repo, it can be accessed and downloaded from AWS. Please use the following commands for downloading the training and testing sets: `aws s3 cp s3://spacenet-dataset/spacenet/SN3_roads/tarballs/SN3_roads_train_AOI_4_Shanghai.tar.gz .`, `aws s3 cp s3://spacenet-dataset/spacenet/SN3_roads/tarballs/SN3_roads_test_public_AOI_4_Shanghai.tar.gz .`.
